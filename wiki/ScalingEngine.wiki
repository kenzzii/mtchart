#summary Notes concerning the implementation of the automatic scaling engine
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The automatic scaling is implemented using the algorithm proposed by W.J. Dixon and R.A. Kronmal (University of California, Los Angeles) in their publication _The Choice of Origin and Scale for Graphs_ (1965). It improves on ideas formulated by T. Giammo (Space Technology Laboratories, Inc., Redondo Beach, California) in his publication _A Mathematical Method for the Automatic Scaling of a Function_ (1964). Hence the phrase _using space technology_ on the project homepage.

Further improvement on the engine has been done by Michael Mayer (University of Berne, Switzerland).

||*Paper*||*mtChart*||*Description*||
||S||$DivisionCount/$nint||Number of intervals on the axis, equals (marks minus one)||
||A||$VMin (Before calculation)/$A||Minimum value on the plot||
||B||$VMax (Before calculation)/$B||Maximum value on the plot||
||R||$DataRange/$R||Range of all values, equals ($VMax - $VMin)||
||a||$VMin/$a||Minimum value for the scale||
||b||$VMax/$b||Maximum value for the scale||
||s||$DivisionWidth/$DivisionRatio||Ratio of values/divisions||

= Set definition =
{{{
$p = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
}}}

The problem lies with division counts like 4 where we would like to see 0.25-values.
